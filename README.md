# SuperDuperLucky
A base project for SDL in C

A little project implementing all the cool stuff you can do using SDL.
I mainly use this so I don't have to rewrite everything when I want to work on a new SDL project.

Dependencies:
    -> SDL
    -> SDL_ttf

To compile:
```
gcc *.c -o SuperDuperLucky -Wall -std=c99 -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf -lm
```
